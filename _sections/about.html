		!@#$% is the alias of Jill, lovingly referred to as "Expletive" and occasionally "Jill". The project started as a diversion, and grew into more of a diversion. !@#$% is and will always be a friend of <a href="http://cakefactory.party/">cake factory</a>, a very irregular techno night in Boston, with cake sometimes. !@#$%'s hobbies include: sewing, taking walks, making websites, complaining, and baking lemon squares. !@#$%'s first gig was in a basement at 5pm on a Sunday.
