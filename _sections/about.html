				<p>!@#$% is the alias of Jill, lovingly referred to as</p>

				<p>"Expletive" and occasionally</p>

				<p> "Jill".</p>
				<p>The project started as a way to pass time.</p>
				 
				<p>Fortunately, music is a very time-</p>
				<p>consuming.</p>

				<p>!@#$% is and will always be a friend of 
				<p><a href="http://cakefactory.party/">cake factory</a>, a semi regular techno ni</p>

				<p>ght in Boston, with cake sometimes. !@#$</p>
				<p>%'s hobbies include: </p>
				<p>sewing, taking walks, making websites, complaining, </p>
				<p>and baking lemon squares. !@#$%'s first gig was</p>

				<p> in a basement at 5pm on a Sunday, and she might have </p>
				<p>had an allergic reaction to the fog machine.</p>
